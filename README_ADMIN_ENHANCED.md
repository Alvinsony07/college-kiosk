## üõ† Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Migration

The enhanced system automatically creates new database tables and columns:

- `audit_logs` table for tracking admin actions
- `updated_at` column added to orders table
- `created_at` and `updated_at` columns added to menu table

### 2. Backend Dependencies

No additional Python packages required. The enhanced system uses existing Flask dependencies.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd college-kiosk

# The enhanced files are ready to use
# Replace the original admin files or use alongside them
```

### 4. Server Configuration

Add routes to serve the enhanced files in your Flask app:

```python
@app.route('/admin-enhanced')
def admin_enhanced():
    return send_from_directory(FRONTEND_DIR, 'admin_enhanced.html')

@app.route('/admin_enhanced.css')
def admin_enhanced_css():
    return send_from_directory(FRONTEND_DIR, 'admin_enhanced.css')

@app.route('/admin_enhanced.js')
def admin_enhanced_js():
    return send_from_directory(FRONTEND_DIR, 'admin_enhanced.js')
```

Administrators can identify popular items, optimize preparation schedules, and reduce waste through accurate demand forecasting.

**Financial Intelligence**: Detailed revenue tracking, average order value analysis, and category-wise sales breakdowns provide crucial financial metrics. This enables budget planning, pricing optimization, and identification of high-margin opportunities that directly impact profitability.
